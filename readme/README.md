# How to make a good commit

Good commit messages help your teammates understand your changes, track project progress, and facilitate teamwork.

The commit message should explain what you did and why wihout going into technical details.

Every commit message must have a commit convention at the beginning.


There are different types of commit conventions:

```
feat = Commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature 
fix = Commits that fix bug of a preceded feat commit
docs =  Commits that exclusively affect documentation
style Commits that address code style (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons) and do not affect application behavior
refactor = Commits that rewrite or restructure code without changing the code's behavior
test = Commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones

```


Example of different commit by professionals:

```
feat: add email notifications on new direct messages

fix: add missing parameter to service call

docs: update README with setup instructions

style: remove empty line

refactor: implement fibonacci number calculation as recursion

test: add tests for login API

```
